This project is purely **JavaFX** - it gives you a basis of what to do regarding your projects, **Note:** it is not a fully fledged system. Some of the things covered apart from UI design is

  - Adding data to tableview
  - Setting Application Icon
  - Showing FXML as modals

### Libraries

This project uses a number of libraries:

* [FontAwesome](https://bintray.com/jerady/maven/FontAwesomeFX/9.1.2) - Icons
* [CalendarFX](https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX) - sophisticated calendar views based on JavaFX.
